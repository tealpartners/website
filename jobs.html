        <h2>Your profile</h2>
        <p>You are an all-round development talent working on the Microsoft .NET-stack and familiar with the latest web technologies (typescript, Angular, Webpack).

            A working application isn't enough for you. You thrive when building beautiful, user friendy applications and you're always looking for better solutions.

            You're a real teamplayer, totally into modern tooling like gulp, bower, npm and nuget, who loves to make fun at work.

            You are looking for an organization where you can use your full potential, where you can leave your mark and take responsibility.

            You're analytical and strong in modelling domain and database models.

            You know what it is to deploy and maintain an application in production in a sustainable way.</p>

        <h2>What do we have to offer</h2>
        <p>You're about to join a young and passionate team of software craftsmen located at 't Eilandje in Antwerp. A great environment in a vibrant city!

            We work in sustainable partnerships with our customers and help them realise challenging and innovative software platforms. If you love big ideas, then this will really be something for you!

            Our organization design is based on the teal principles described by Frederic Laloux in his book "Reinventing organizations". This makes us another kind of organization, one where you will feel like home!

            You are responsible for your own time. You can work from the office, from home, in the early morning, in the late evening. It 's up to you!

            And of course we 'll take care for everything necessary to make you thrive:

            The combination of a competitive salary and a "flex" budget you can spend on benefits;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> A mobility budget that fits your needs: company car, rail card, bike, bus, ... pick your ideal combination!</li>
            <li>Hospitalisation and group insurance</li>
            <li>A high-end laptop (Dell XPS 15, MacBook pro, ...);</li>
            <li>A top smartphone (IPhone 7, Google Pixel, OnePlus 3, HTC 10, ...);</li>
