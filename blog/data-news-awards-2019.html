        <h1 class="page__title">Data News awards</h1>
        <p class="page__meta">By Laila Bougria on 23 May 2019</p>
        <p class="page__intro">Most of us in the IT industry have read a Data News magazine at one point or another in our career.
            This popular IT-focussed periodical keeps us up to date oninnovations and developments in our industry.
            Each year, Data News selects the most innovative IT-companies in a celebration called the Data News Awards
            for Excellence. Last week we were honoured to join in on the 20th edition of this event.</p>

    <div class="page__content">
        <p>
            The event started early for us at Teal Partners, as the office transformed in an actual Suits set. Our clothing rack filled
            up with elegant suits and cocktail dresses. By 4 it was time for the girls to get ready, so they pulled out
            the shiny high heels and the make-up bags. A few hours later it was time for our men to suit up. As we
            basically have no dress code at work and everybody mostly chooses jeans every day, it was an absolute
            delight to see everyone channel their inner Harvey Specter or Donna Paulsen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The evening was hosted at one
            of the Brussels Expo venues. Mesmerizing circus personalities welcomed us at the red carpet. We took our
            seats and the show began. The Cirque Mystique teaser we saw on the invitation was thoroughly delivered upon
            as we were entertained by fire-breathers, mind-blowing aerial acts and sword-swallowing women. Chief editor
            Kristof van der Stadt and hostess Anne De Baetzelier presented nominees and winners. After inviting the
            winner to the stage, the presenters touched upon their accomplishments as they received their prize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, we weren't amongst the lucky winners. Nevertheless, we are so very proud of what we've
            accomplished in just a few years at Teal Partners. We are particularly fond of our values, our work ethic,
            and the amazingly powerful platform we've built with Viren and the problems we are solving with it. But
            let's be real, we were surrounded by some amazing companies at the awards, with the trusty giants we all
            know like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Huawei, and Proximus, but also smaller companies with some very
            remarkable realisations that really caught our eye. So, we take away tons of inspiration and even more
            motivation to change the world in doing what we do.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had an amazing time as a team and we can't even
            think of one dull moment the whole evening. We claimed about half of the available beer glasses, tested the
            cages that were set for the circus artists and made an abundance of jokes. This might sound clich√©, but one
            of our greatest accomplishments is the compatibility of our team. Put us together in an office (with the
            necessary amountof coffee and sweets) and we'll do great things work-wise. Take away the work, add in some
            drinks and we'll have a great time. It was an absolute pleasure to attend this event.
