            <p class="page__intro">
                At Teal Partners, you are the architect of your own career. We offer context, not control. We look after each other.
                That may sound strange for an IT company, a traditionally male dominated industry. To us, though, this kind of care is 
                essential. Our men and women come first. They are what makes the company. Their happiness is our success.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page__content" style="padding-top: 0;">
            <p>Teal Partners is more than a collection of individuals. We are a team and we stand up for each other. We are in it 
                for the long term. With our customers and our employees. EQ is just as important as IQ. Genius but antisocial? Sorry, but you 
                won't flourish here. 
            </p><p>
                We are a knowledge company. So, of course we choose to work with bright minds who excel at their jobs. Our consultants have ten years' 
                experience on average. They are experienced professionals with vast expertise. A mix of 
                generalists who see the bigger picture and specialists with a sharp focus. 
            </p>
            <p>Strong profiles have to be cherished. They thrive best in an environment where there is freedom. Our people work where they want, 
                when they want. It's all about the results. Freedom does come with responsibility, though. Only people who can handle 
                this are a good fit for us. 
            </p><p>
                We see our employees as the smart, self-managing people they are. There are no bosses or departments. Everyone is their own boss. We 
                run the company together. We divide the tasks and set up teams to carry them out. From HR to marketing, from recruitment to 
                teambuilding. Our employees choose what responsibilities they want to take on.
            </p>
            <p>Reading <i>Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux</i> only confirmed our vision. Self-management is neither hype nor a sacred 
                principle to us. It's an ideal we put into practice day in, day out. Through trial and error. A culture of consultation must never get 
                bogged down in stagnation or indecisiveness. We are very mindful of this. 
            </p><p>
                We know each other's wages. Only when there is openness can you map out the future of the company together. Transparency engenders trust. When 
                personal goals are aligned with the goals of the organisation, beautiful things happen. 
            </p>
