                Commissioned by HR service provider SD Worx, Teal Partners is developing a revolutionary piece of
                software set to transform the core of the business. ‘We are evolving from a service
                provider that calculates wages and salaries into an HR partner for our clients and their staff,’
                explains Henri Vanroelen, CIO at SD Worx. ‘Teal Partners has a unique combination of technical expertise
                and exhaustive insight into what it is that our clients want. This helps us to better serve our target
                group, whilst taking into account evolutions in the market.’

        <h2>The Company</h2>
        <p>
            SD Worx is an HR and payroll service provider. Based in Belgium, the company has evolved from its origins as
            a secretary’s offices performing administrative tasks on behalf of employers to become a leading
            international specialist in HR policy and processes. Its clients include employers in a wide range of
            industries, from SMEs through to multinationals. SD Worx now takes care of the payroll for 4.4 million
            employees.
        </p>

        <p>
            At SD Worx, innovation is in the DNA. In the 1960s, the company was one of the first to start using a
            computer to support its day-to-day operations. It was at the forefront of service digitalisation,
            offering tools to help with flexible remuneration, salary budgeting, calculating notice periods and annual
            leave and implementing mobility budgets. With robotisation and AI, staff at SD Worx can now focus on the
            areas of their business where human contact makes all the difference.
        </p>

        <h2>In figures</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>€425 million turnover</li>
            <li>4,100 employees</li>
            <li>90 countries</li>
            <li>65.000 clients</li>
            <li>75 years’ experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>

        <p>
            Clients of SD Worx and their staff are looking for bespoke software and service. There is growing interest
            in making contact more individual. Technology that people use at home is setting the standard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flexible working is becoming increasingly important, and companies are more likely to purchase services from
            freelancers. Employees have increasing flexibility in how they spend their salary. A flexible payroll
            package and HR software are, therefore, quite indispensable
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Teal Partners is helping us to develop software that can respond to the new reality,’ explains Henri
            Vanroelen of SD Worx. ‘We want to give clients a clear picture of their company so that they can better
            assess their employment policy and its financial impact. We want to give them certainty that they are
            working to current regulations.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘At the same time, we also want to give their employees clarity on their remuneration, net salary and the
            options available to them for alternative remuneration, all tailored to them individually.’
        </p>
        <p>
            SD Worx operates in 90 countries. ‘There’s no software out there that we can easily copy to allow us to
            offer our services in other countries. Legislation is different in every country, which makes it all more
            complex. It’s the Holy Grail of our industry. With the new platform that we’re developing with Teal
            Partners, we think that we have the solution.’
        </p>

        <h2>Conditions and methodology</h2>

        <p>
            The mass customisation trend has infiltrated the services sector, explains Henri Vanroelen. ‘Take the
            automotive industry, for instance. There are innumerable options available to help turn what is a
            mass-produced product into a unique vehicle that meets your requirements. That’s what our software needs to
            do. We can’t build a separate system for every user, but we still want to provide him with an individual,
            personal service without creating a monster that is unmanageable.’
        </p>
        <p>
            The software needs to operate flawlessly. ‘People use their computers for online banking and shopping and
            these days, those things run pretty smoothly. People expect the same ease of use from software that they
            use professionally.’
        </p>
        <p>
            SD Worx has clients in a range of industries, large and small. As such, it’s important that software is
            both horizontally and vertically scalable. ‘In other words, our software needs to work in the same way for
            SMEs as it does for multinationals. The butcher and the baker need to benefit from it, as does a consultancy
            firm or IT company.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Teal Partners has had a team of twelve working on the innovative software for a year now. ‘It’s not the
            first project that we’ve worked on together, but it’s certainly the biggest,’ explains Henri Vanroelen. The
            current software unites earlier projects and frames them into something much larger. ‘It reaches into the
            core of our business and has the potential to change our business from the inside.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Teal Partners?</h2>
        <p>
            For Henri Vanroelen, Teal Partners offers a unique combination of exhaustive industry knowledge and in-depth
            technology insights. ‘Teal Partners is very skilled at cloud development and technology. Equally important $
            as their technical expertise is their capacity to understand our business and what our clients want. It’s
            not just a technology’s ability to amaze that makes it work, our software needs to make our clients’ lives
            easier. Teal Partners knows how to do that.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘By abstracting the right things, Teal Partners has succeeded in building a platform that makes adjusting
            regulations and knowledge and performing calculations entirely manageable. This makes a huge difference,
            especially in a sector like ours where regulations play such an important role.’ Vanroelen believes that
            enterprises such as insurers, national health services, pension funds and pharmaceuticals companies will
            benefit from the platform
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Teal Partners brings forward ideas, they don’t just execute. There’s a great deal of mutual trust. We help
            to reinforce one another. They provide us the software and technology to raise the bar on our service
            offering, and even radically innovate. We are sharing our knowledge and giving them access to a market
            that is enabling them to develop a platform that they may be able to deploy in other industries in the
            future.‘
        </p>
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>
            ‘The software reaches to the core of our business – wage and salary calculation. With progressive insight,
            we’re constantly able to accelerate this process,’ explains Henri Vanroelen. ‘At the same time, it gives
            employers greater insight into their HR processes. Data from the industry and from the company itself allow
            employers to make better decisions. The system will generate simulations and give advice pro-actively.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example, an employer will receive a notification informing him or her that e-bikes are a smart
            investment, taking into account current regulations and the team’s daily commuting distance. Or, the
            system will inform him or her about how the company is doing in the industry in terms of fringe benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Employees will also be able to receive tips and advice. The platform can provide specific, personal
            responses to questions such as ‘How much will I earn if I work part-time?’ or ‘What’s left of my salary if
            I replace my company car with the mobility budget?’. Employees also receive advice and recommendations to
            take annual leave promptly or warnings about working overtime for weeks. They will also have more insight
            into their remuneration and can generate simulations, showing them how to spend their salary more flexibly,
            for example.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            ‘Thanks to Teal Partners, we now have a solution that is scalable, easy to maintain and versatile. It was
            never the intention to build an international payroll solution, but the software that we are developing has
            that potential,’ concludes Henri Vanroelen. ‘The system is faster than ever and has the flexibility to add
            new regulations. The software allows our clients and their employees to generate simulations of their HR
            situations and gives tailored advice, even pro-actively.’
