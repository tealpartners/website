The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) organizes one of the world's most important AI conferences. "The AI research field is quite competitive," says Wannes Meert, research manager of Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence (DTAI) at KU Leuven. "That our joint work has been selected to present at the AAAI conference and especially as one of the winners of an IAAI Deployed Applications Award is of course incredible."

The paper describes the use of AI to calculate the potential impact of changes in payment policies. Koen Denies: "The principles we describe in the paper form the foundation of our VIREN decision engine. In the paper, we elaborate on a specific case in the HR and payroll sector, where our decision engine has been active for more than a year. We are proud that our technology now also receives an important academic recognition."

Wannes Meert and Sebastijan Dumancic from the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at KU Leuven and Teal Partners Stijn Goethals, Tim Stuyckens, Jelle Huygen and Koen Denies collaborated on the final result.
