The "Technology Fast 50"-award goes to Belgium's fastest-growing technology company based on the percentage of revenue 
growth over the past four years. "We are honored to be a part of this list, all the more because some impressive names
accompany us", says Koen Denies, co-founder of Teal Partners. "Entrepreneurship can be a hard path to follow. This
recognition ensures that we are on the right track. It gives us a significant energy boost."

<h2>Thanks to the team</h2>

According to Jelle Huygen, the team spirit is the foundation of success at Teal Partners. "This nomination is the
result of the hard work of our entire team. Every day, our employees prove that you can achieve great things together. 
In the last months, during the crisis, everyone stepped up a notch. Significantly, almost all our new projects stem 
from word of mouth."

Teal Partners organizes the company according to the principle of self-management. Koen Denies: "Our culture is not 
based on the pursuit of fast growth rates. We are strongly committed to autonomy and happiness at work. It is nice to 
see that our loyalty to this mission translates into rapid growth, without growth being a goal in itself. We want to 
make things we believe in, with a team of dedicated people."
 
<h2>Network</h2>

The "Deloitte Technology Fast 50"-competition helps companies develop their business by increasing their visibility and 
giving them access to the Fast 50's network of successful executives. Having over 4,500 employees and twelve offices in 
Belgium, Deloitte is a leader in audit, accounting, legal and tax advice, consultancy, financial advice, and risk 
advice. The company organizes the competition in collaboration with investment company Fortino, software company 
NetSuite and Vlerick Business School.

Only Belgian technology companies founded before January 1, 2016, with an operating income of at least € 50,000 in 2016 
and € 1,000,000 in 2019 are eligible to participate in the "Technology Fast 50" competition. According to Deloitte, 
these companies earn special recognition and support, given their important role as future growth drivers. The winner 
will be announced on November 26, 2020.
