<h2>Add the chemistry of a startup to your corporate environment</h2>
<p>It is really challenging to innovate inside an existing and successful company. Since a couple of years,
corporates are adding corporate accelerators to their innovation programs.</p>
<p>Such partnerships between corporates and startups combine the best of both worlds. They improve time to
    market, create extra flexibility, boost operating speed, increase brand awareness and act as a neutral
    party in co-sourcing or co-funding tracks.</p>
<p>This is where Teal Partners comes in. We are a small and flexible community of multi-disciplinary craftsmen,
    specifically founded to generate and realise innovative, ambitious ideas within the ecosystem of a
    corporate environment.</p>
