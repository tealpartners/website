Yes, you could say I’m inquisitive. I love immersing myself in the customer’s business. Looking for solutions. Continuously learning and trying out new things. It keeps me mentally fit. My passion is writing flexible code for software that you can easily incorporate into the complex projects we do. 



Developing is a creative job. People are surprised when I say this. But there are different ways to produce a result. Is it important that your software evolves with the needs of the users or new systems in the market? If yes, you have to code in a different way, more creatively, let’s say.



In secondary school, I studied bookkeeping and computer science. My plan was to become a teacher but one my teachers advised me to choose computer science instead. He had noticed that I had a real knack for logical thinking. I’m still grateful to him to this day. Programming is my dream job. What’s more, I’m at my best when I’m given the freedom to organise my job the way I like. 



With freedom comes responsibility. I love taking initiative and that is something that is encouraged at Teal Partners. I’m self-employed and yet, I never get the feeling that I’m an outsider. In other companies, freelancers often miss out, for instance, at team-building sessions. That’s not the case at Teal Partners. I’m part of the team, just as much as anyone else. 



I love my job very much but my private life is just as important to me. I’m a mum to three young children and my husband is also a software developer. A healthy work-life balance is crucial and at Teal Partners, I have just that. They respect and understand the need for a private life. You choose where and when you work. When I was laid up at home for three weeks following an operation, I worked from my sofa. Flexibility goes both ways. 



IT is a man’s world. There are still machos around who think that a woman in high heels can’t possibly be an ace at coding. You don’t hear that kind of nonsense here. You don’t get fewer opportunities just because you can get pregnant. And believe me, I have had different experiences. In IT, too, women often earn less. Sometimes because they don’t like to negotiate. But it’s not because you don’t like to negotiate that you are worth less. At Teal Partners, they understand that. By the way, that kind of disparity is not an issue here because our wages are transparent. 



My philosophy as a developer is: I don’t know anything really. There are so many technologies. There is so much to learn. Things are changing at lightning speed. However much you think you know, it’s only the tip of the iceberg. That’s why I see myself as a sponge. We have a team of aces with a broad, solid foundation. And yet, everyone here is modest. We realise that we have to learn from each other. There isn’t an IT specialist in the world who is that impressive that they know everything. In a fast-changing world, you need each other.
